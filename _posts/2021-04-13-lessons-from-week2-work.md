## Notes from working through Helper Methods
---

- I need to work on my keyboard shortcuts in Gitpod to increase productivity, e.g., multiselect of text.
- https://3000-white-bedbug-zdxbutfb.ws-us03.gitpod.io/rails/info/routes
- ALWAYS use names for routes so your code is more robust - only have URLs in routes
- In controller, use the fully qualified URL versus the path
- NEVER right another raw a element again in our templates
