## Office hours with Raghu
---

### Agenda
- Vision for Career Change: Fullstack Developer (& Boot Camp/Resource Preferences)
- Learning Algorithm/Syntax vs. Deeper Understanding of the Languages
- Vision for Course Project: CheckList for Parenting



### Notes
- Continuing after the class: (i) The bootcamps have a such a range of quality (Actualize and Galvenize are known quantities) (ii) Actualize is going to be rudimentary to push me. Part time programs are too slow and not strong. (iii) It'd be better to do an intense one that is full-time, needs to be selective, maybe Hack Reactor. 
- Full-time program would be recommended
- Bootcamp worked well for me. If you are going to do it, go full-time and go for the most selective program possible.
- I could get just go for apprenticeship now with a few projects.
- Leverage Raghu for code review
- One path: I have constant projects that I cannot do. If you want to work on some stuff that isn't urgent, you can take a stab at it.
- What's next: (i) Bootcamp can work, (ii) Speaking with Josh Ellis about project for the summer internship, (iii) Raghu could hire me to do a small project Raghu (the work would be an apprenticeship)
- Take a look at bootcamps - consider pulling trigger for a summer project

- Course Project
-   Add a native client in the long term
-   Initially as a web app
-   Consider doing nice things that bookmark it to homescreen to add icons (to look like an app)
-   Domain model
-   Kid View + Parent View
