## My random notes from class #4

- To build the interface around all the RCAVs:
- 'rails g devise:view'
- `rails g devise:views`
- Then you edit the views per todays examples


- Hiding buttons != secure
- The first few lines of code in every action will be for authorization (in controllers)
- Typically check to see if the user has access to take the action
