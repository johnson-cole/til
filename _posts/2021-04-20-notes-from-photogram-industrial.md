- Adding and removing columns from table: https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/770#adding-or-removing-columns-from-your-table; Also see the Piazza discussion.
- More generically, the following guidance is useful: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html


I'm feeling pretty behind this week. I need to dedicate more time to reviewing materials and practicing coding, but am having trouble balancing against work and family. No excuses, just putting it out in the internet ether. I want to make a career transition, but right now I don't see a feasible path that also allows me to keep my current job. Dum dum dum....

Things to Spend More Time Learning:
- https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/852 - Creating Sample Data
- I do not know how to take advantage of bootstrap for a "fresh" Ruby on Rails build. I need to figure this out, likely for class project.
