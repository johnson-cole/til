- I've learned more about the maps method, which keeps coming up as useful. More specifically, I read about the idiomatic use of the map method as described here: https://www.brianstorti.com/understanding-ruby-idiom-map-with-symbol/.  It discusses the use of array.map(&:method_name), as the "&" usage was confusing.
